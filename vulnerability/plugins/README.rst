Each plugin in this folder defines one or more vulnerabilities and implements the check for them.
A check must be decorated with @ call_with or @settings_call_with for checks that run on a settings.py file. The
decorators take one argument: The name of the ast node class which will be passed to the functions node parameter.
The functions self parameter is an instance of the analyzer.analyzer.Analyzer class.
Through the decorator each function will be dynamically registered as a function in the Analyzer named
"visit\_" + the ast node class name passed to the decorator. Thus the function will be called during the call to
analyzer.visit()
